for now, the only class that you should worry about, is the LevelEditorScene.java .
the structure and functions are similar to unity.
there is the init() method that gets called when the scene is created
the update method is called every frame
create gameObjects like the example below

obj1 = new GameObject("Object 1", new Transform(new Vector2f(200, 100), new Vector2f(256, 256)), 1);

it has a name, a transform, and a zIndex

the only component that is available right now is a SpriteRenderer
you can add a SpriteRenderer like below

obj1.addComponent(new SpriteRenderer(new Sprite(AssetPool.getTexture("PATH_TO_YOUR_TEXTURE"))));

NOTE:
after creating a gameObject you NEED to add it to the scene
this.addGameObjectToScene(obj1);

you can use spritesheets too

there is full support for mouse and keyboard too

you can create you own components by extending your class from Component.java class (its something like unity scripts)
